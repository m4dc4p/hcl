This module provides a set of functions for building simple command-line interfaces. It allows interfaces which collect values (such as Integers, Dates, or other structured values), build lists of values, and use simple menus. It is not intended to build complex interfaces with full cursor control. It is oriented towards line-based interfaces.

/Requests/

The central concept of the library is the 'Request' type, which embodies an interactive request for data. When requesting data, there is always the possibility of failure. That is, the user may enter a value that doesn't parse, or may want to quit the process. For this reason, the value stored by a request is @"IO" ("Maybe" a)@, which shows there may not always be a value available. 'Request' is a monad, and when a request fails, no subsequent requests are asked. Instead, the whole request chain is abandoned.

The function 'reqResp' gives the most basic request possible, which is for a string. From this, other requests can be built. The library provides several:

 * 'reqInt' - Requests "Int" values.

 * 'reqInteger' - Requests "Integer" values.

 * 'reqChar' - Requests a single character (without waiting for the user to press enter)

 * 'reqPassword' - Like 'reqResp', but doesn't echo the user's input to the console.

 * 'reqRead' - Requests "Read"-able values.

 * 'reqList' - Asks a request repeatedly and builds a list of the responses, which are returned when the user
    enters a failure value.

 * 'reqMenu' - Given a list of items, asks the user to pick one of the items and returns it.

 * 'reqFail' - Always results in failure. Useful in menus for creating a \"quit\" or \"none\" selection.

A number of request patterns are also exported by the module. These embody different control schemes that are useful when building command-line interfaces. These include:

  * 'reqIf' - Takes a request which evaluates to a boolean and two requests representing \"then\" and \"else\" branches. The appropriate subsequent request is used, based on the value of the conditional request.
  
  * 'reqAgree' - Takes a request and determines if the user answers yes or no. A default can also be provided.
  
  * 'reqForever' - Takes a request and asks it over and over, until a failure value appears.
  
  * 'reqIterate' - Takes a function which, given a value, produces a request. An initial 'Request' value is also provided. The initial value is given to the function, and the value produced by the function is fed back into it. This continues until a failure occurs. This model is useful for shell-type applications which take a state, operate on it, and produce a new state, which is then fed back in.
  
  * 'reqCont' - Takes a request and a \"continuation\" request. If the first request fails, the \"continuation\" request is run. This is useful for confirming if the user really wants to quit an application, or other escape mechanisms. 

/Running Requests/

Requests can be run with two different functions:

  * 'execReq' - Takes a request, runs it, and returns a meaningless value. This is most often used to run a request from \'main\'.
  
  * 'runRequest' - Runs a request and returns the raw @"IO" ("Maybe a")@ value returned. This is useful for   running a request and extracting the value returned out of it.
  
/Prompting/

In most req functions, except 'reqMenu' and 'reqChoices', nothing is printed to the screen. Instead, a set of functions is provided which take a request and a string to use as a prompt. These functions include:

  * 'prompt' - Displays a message and gets a response. If the message ends in a space, it is assumed that input should be typed on the same line. Otherwise, a newline is printed and input is then gathered.

  * 'prompt1' -- Simple way to ask for a response and provide a default.

  * 'promptAgree' -- Simple way to ask for a yes\/no response.

/Simple Programs/

Getting values combines prompting and requests. Here's a \'guess a number\' game which probably isn't real fun (from examples\\guess_num.hs):

> guess_num_boring =
>     do
>       num <- prompt "Enter your guess between 1 - 100: " reqInt
>       if num == 50
>         then reqIO $ putStrLn "You win!"
>         else reqIO $ putStrLn "Too bad!"

To run the program, type @play_game guess_num_boring@ at the prompt. A better program might actually randomize the number, and tell you if you are low or high (again from examples\\guess_num.hs):


> guess_num_fun =
>       do
>         target <- reqIO $ getStdRandom (randomR (1::Integer,100))
>         let guessed val =
>               case compare target val of
>                 GT -> do { reqIO $ putStrLn "Too low!"; return False }
>                 LT -> do { reqIO $ putStrLn "Too high!"; return False }
>                 EQ -> do { reqIO $ putStrLn "You win!"; return True }
>         reqUntil guessed (prompt "Enter a number between 1 and 100: " reqInteger)
> 
> play_game game = execReq game

To run the program, type @play_game guess_num_fun@ at the prompt. Several features of this program are worth pointing out:

  * 'reqIO' - This function is used to lift IO operations into the 'Request' type.
  
  * 'reqUntil' - This function takes a condition and a request, and runs the request until the condition is satisfied. The conditional has the type @(a -> Request b)@, which allows the conditional to produce output, or base its decision on other requests. Naturally, the second argument has the type @(Request a)@, which means the result of the request can be passed to the condition. Other functions which wrap up input patterns are 'reqFoldl', 'reqList', 'reqCont', and others.
  
/Combining Requests/

The functions in this library are designed to allow more complex 'Request' values to be built from them. For example, imagine you are coding for a tax form submission and have a data type like this (from examples\\taxpayer.hs):

>  data Taxpayer = Taxpayer { name :: String, age :: Int, ssn :: String }
>   deriving (Read, Show)

Because @Taxpayer@ derives "Read", a simple way of collecting a @Taxpayer@ value from the user would be:

> reqTaxpayer :: Request Taxpayer
> reqTaxpayer = prompt "Please enter tax payer information: " (reqRead reqResp)

Of course, this isn't very friendly:

> *Main> getTaxpayer reqTaxpayer
> Please enter tax payer information: Taxpayer {name="John", age = 30, ssn = "" }
> You entered: Taxpayer {name = "John", age = 30, ssn = ""}

Typing @Taxpayer { name = \"John\" ... }@ each time
is pretty tedious. A better solution builds the value from simpler pieces:

> reqTaxpayerEasy :: Request Taxpayer
> reqTaxpayerEasy =
>   do
>     name <- prompt "Please enter the tax payer's name: " reqResp
>     age <- prompt "Please enter their age: " reqInt
>     ssn <- prompt "What is their SSN/ASN: " reqResp
>     return (Taxpayer name age ssn)

Now, when tax payer info must be entered a nice set of prompts is displayed:

> *Main> getTaxpayer reqTaxpayerEasy
> Please enter the tax payer's name: Bob
> Please enter their age: 50
> Please enter their SSN/ASN: 111-11-1111
> You entered: Taxpayer {name = "Bob", age = 50, ssn = "111-11-1111"}

/Validation/

HCL provides the 'reqWhile' and 'reqUntil' functions which help ensure values entered are correct. For example, in the above, we could validate SSN's fairly easily like so (again, from example\\tax_payer.hs):

> reqSSN :: Request String -> Request String
> reqSSN req =
>   do
>     -- very simple validation
>     let
>       matchSSN = matchRegex (mkRegex "^...-..-....$")
>       invalidSSN ssn = return $ isNothing (matchSSN ssn)
>     ssn <- reqWhile invalidSSN req
>     return ssn

In the above, 'reqWhile' repeatedly uses @invalidSSN@ to determine if the value entered matches the (very simple) regular expression provided. When it does, the SSN entered is returned. Until then, the request is asked over and over. One subtlety to note is that a request to get the actual value is passed in to the function as @req@. This allows the function @reqTaxpayerValidate@ to pass it's own prompt and request into reqSSN:

> reqTaxpayerValidate :: Request Taxpayer
> reqTaxpayerValidate =
>   do
>     name <- prompt "Please enter the tax payer's name: " reqResp
>     age <- prompt "Please enter their age: " reqInt
>     ssn <- reqSSN (prompt "What is their SSN/ASN: " reqResp)
>     return (Taxpayer name age ssn)

Running @reqTaxpayerValidate@ from the prompt then gives:

> *Main> getTaxpayer reqTaxpayerValidate
> Please enter the tax payer's name: Bob
> Please enter their age: 20
> What is their SSN/ASN: 324=12=1231
> What is their SSN/ASN: 324-12-1211
> You entered: Taxpayer {name = "Bob", age = 20, ssn = "324-12-1211"}

/Dealing with Failure/

A fundamental assumption of the 'Request' type is that requests can fail. The user can enter no input or provide bad input. The discussion of validation above is a bit disingenuous because it does not mention what happens when the user just types a newline at the prompt. In all cases, the request chain ends and the program exits.

This is due to the behavior of the 'Request' monad - as soon as one request fails, the rest fail. The library provides several functions for dealing with this:

  * 'reqDefault' - Allows a default value to be supplied, which will be returned if the user provides no input or bad input.
  
  * 'required' - Repeatedly asks a request until the user provides input. \"Failure\" values will not occur.
  
  * 'reqCont' - Takes two request arguments. If the first fails, the second is used. Useful for providing a \"continuation\" to a request chain.
  
  * 'reqWhich' - Indicates if a request failed or not, through the use of the "Either" type. There is no direct way to determine if a request failed (that is, if it evaluates to Nothing, the entire chain fails and you won't see it). This function allows some visibility into if a specific request succeeded or not.

One use for 'reqCont' is to confirm if the user really wants to quit a program.  In the guess-a-number game, hitting Enter at a prompt stops the game. This can be avoided by changing how the guess a number game is launched:

> guess_num_cont =
>     reqCont guess_num_fun confirm
>   where
>     confirm =
>       reqIf (promptAgree "Are you sure you want to quit? " (Just False) reqResp)
>         reqFail
>         guess_num_cont

Above, 'reqCont' will run @guess_num_fun@ until it returns a @Just@ value. If @Nothing@ is returned, then @reqConfirm@ is run. If the user does not wish to quit, @reqConfirm@ will run @guess_num_confirm@ again. Otherwise, 'reqFail' is run, which causes the request to fail and thus the program to exit. Notice that the confirmation behavior was added by just adding another layer to the request chain. The @guess_num_fun@ function was used to provide gameplay - @guess_num_confirm@ just added a layer to control when the game ends.

However, because this pattern is fairly common, HCL provides the 'reqConfirm' function, which acts just like the 'reqCont' pattern above. That is, it takes a request to run and a request which returns a "Bool". If the initial request fails, the confirmation request is run. If that request results in @True@, the failure is allowed to propagate. Otherwise, the initial request is run again. The function @guess_num_confirm@ gives an example of its usage:

> guess_num_confirm =
>     reqConfirm confirm guess_num_fun 
>   where
>     confirm = promptAgree "Are you sure you want to quit? " (Just False) reqResp

  
/Making Menus/  

Several functions are used to build simple, hierarchical menus. A menu is defined as a list of pairs, where the first element is the label and the second a value to return. Usually, that value is a 'Request'. In some cases it is not. There are two functions used for building menus:

  * 'reqChoices' - A low-level means to build menus. It does not expect the second item in the pair to be a request, and is thus very general. 
  
  * 'reqMenu' - Expects the list given to be a pair of a string and another request. When an item is   selected, that request is run and the value is returned.
  
  * 'reqSubMenu' - Inserts a menu into a menu. When the item for the submenu is selected, the submenu will display its choices. When the user wishes to exit (by providing a failure value), the previously displayed menu will display again.
  
  * 'reqMenuItem' - Constructs an indvidual menu item.
  
  * 'reqMenuEnd' - Indicates the end of a list of menu items.
  
  * 'reqMenuExit' - A specialized menu item which will cause the menu request to fail. That means we return to the previous menu or exit the request chain altogether, depending on how the menus are structured.
  
'reqMenu' and 'reqSubMenu' work together to build hierarchical menus in which the user can automatically navigate \"up\" by just hitting return. For example, imagine a simple menu-driven PIM:

> *Main> pim
> 1. Manage contacts
> 2. Manage calendar
> ? 1
> 1. Add a contact
> 2. Remove a contact
> ? <-- User hits return here, returns to main menu
> 1. Manage contacts
> 2. Manage calendar
> ?

Setting this up is fairly straightforward (from examples\\pim.hs):

> pim = execReq $ reqConfirm confirm topMenu 
>   where
>     confirm = promptAgree "Are you sure you want to quit?" (Just False) reqResp
>     
> topMenu =
>   reqMenu $
>   -- Insert a submenu defined elsewhere
>   reqSubMenu topMenu "Manage contacts" manageContactsMenu $
>   -- Insert a sub menu directly
>   reqSubMenu topMenu "Manage calendar"
>     (reqMenuItem "Add an event" notImpl $
>       ...
>       reqMenuExit "Return to previous menu"
>       reqMenuEnd) $
>   ...
>   -- End the menu definition
>   reqMenuEnd
>   
> -- Defines a partial menu
> manageContactsMenu =
>   reqMenuItem "Add a contact" notImpl $
>   ...
>   reqMenuExit "Return to previous menu"
>   reqMenuEnd
> 
> notImpl = reqIO $ putStrLn "This function is not implemented."

'reqMenu' begins the process of definining a menu. 'reqMenuItem' is used to build a menu item, and when combined with @($)@ as above can be used to define a list of menu items \"in-line\". 'reqSubMenu' takes the menu to return to as its first argument (in the case above, @topMenu@), a label to name the menu item, and a request which will become the submenu. As seen above, submenus can be inserted directly (e.g. \"Manage calendar\"), or they can be defined independently (e.g. \"Manage contacts\"). 'reqMenuExit' allows the submenu to return to control to its calling menu. Finally, 'reqMenuEnd' can be used to end an \"in-line\" menu definition.

/Just Plain Cool/

Some of the other functions included are just cool to use:

  * 'reqIterate' - This take a function which maps a value to a request and a request. The request is evaluated and the results passed to the function. The result of that function is passed back into the function again. 'reqIterate' is useful for applications that manipulate some sort of environment by  repeatedly passing the modified environment back into themselves. An example of this is shown in  examples\\shell.hs where the @shell@ function is repeatedly called from @main@ using 'reqIterate'. The  hangman game in hangman\\hangman.hs also uses this when the @playRound@ function is repeatedly called from @main@.
  
  * 'reqFoldl' - Like @foldl@, but for requests. The accumulating function takes values of type a (which  come from the request given) and type b (the accumulating value) and produces a 'Request' of type b. If and when the initial request fails, whatever accumulated value that was built is returned.
  
  * 'reqList' - Takes a request and repeatedly runs it, building a list of the results. When the request  fails, the list is returned.
  
  * 'makeReq' - Not really so cool, but allows you to construct your own 'Request' values. Values created with 'makeReq' can be extracted with 'runRequest'. However, they will come back with the type @("IO" ("Maybe a")@, where the value is always a @Just@ value.

/Examples/

Several examples are included with the library, including a hangman game you can play:

  * examples\\guess_num.hs - Demonstrates various ways of implementing a "guess a number" game.
  
  * examples\\pim.hs - Shows how to build simple menus.
  
  * examples\\shell.hs - Shows how to use reqIterate to build a simple shell.
  
  * examples\\tax_payer.hs - Demonstrates how to construct requests for specific structured data types from simpler requests.
  
  * hangman\\hangman.hs - Implements the hangman game. An executable is installed when you install the library - just run @hangman@ at the command line.
